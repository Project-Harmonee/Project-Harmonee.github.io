# User Experience Design Overview

### The Problem. Our Solution
Currently, there are a wealth of resources for learning new instruments and uploading music online on an individual basis. While this is certainly something to be celebrated, there are no resources for musicians to connect with, learn from, inspire, and motivate each other. There are thousands of artists that want to collaborate with others but don’t know where to find people who share similar interests and have the same vision. Even then, people who happen to be in groups feel like they are stuck or stagnating as artists: they don’t know what the next step is. The process of moving from noodling in jam sessions to recording in the studio or performing at gigs is may present a significant challenge. There is plenty of latent potential that is locked away and, as a result, hundreds of songs and musical project not being made. Harmonee’s mission is to unlock this potential, making the logistics of band formation and maintenance from something that is a burden into something that is exciting and painless. Our use of a mobile app format lead to the two tasks we found most important: establishing a network of musicians, and thoughtful preparation for events.

### 4.) Paper Prototype
In order to make our design ideas as iterable as possible, we started by drafting a lo-fi paper prototype that intends to present the genreal aesthetics of our application, as well as to show a more concrete example of how our users might be able to complete the two tasks of interest. This prototype started as a base on which many improvements were made based on later user testing. Below is an overview of the prototype as well as a detailed walk-through of how a user would be able to complete their two primary tasks.


#### Overview

#### Task 1, Building a Musical Network
This is the starting point for the app, which is intended to orient the user's experience closer to whichever task they are looking to complete. Because we are interested in accomplishing the task of building a musical network, we will select "Looking For a Band."
![paper-proto!](/img/paper-proto-start.JPG)

This page allows the user to insert information about themselves that is relevant to finding other musicians that are compatible with them. THey are able to edit each section by tapping on them and typing their desired input. Most notably, the user is told that the matching system will begin after they submit a musical sample that they can record right from the app by pressing "Record Sample."

This is the part of the application where users record their music right into their device. It includes the standard audio recording tools, including playback, stop, and of course, record.

Some time after users have filled out their profile and provided a sample recording of their music, they will receive this notification about a new band matching. From here, they can simply open the notification to see the matching.

This screen shows the user a potential band matching. The page includes information on each of the potential band members, as well as some of the information that was used to make the matching. This screen also notifies the user of a "Test Jam Event" that they have the option of accepting so that they may meet these other musicians, and later potentially start a band.

#### Task 2, Thoughtful Preparation

In addition to one’s individual profile, bands have a band profile shared by the whole group. This page features a picture of the group, the band’s name, a short description, some song links and, importantly, a preparation list for groups to plan for the uncertain.

The first section of the preparation list features missing items. These are items that they missed in their previous performance or considerations that they need to take into account for next time. The Commonly Forgotten section showcases items that are commonly listed across the app as missing. Finally, the goals section shows things that band members want to see in their band.

The calendar section lists upcoming events as specified by users as well as suggested events based on band member schedules.
