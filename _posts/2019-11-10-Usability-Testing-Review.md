# Usability Testing Review

## Usability Test 1 ("Steve Montano"):
For our first usability test, we were able to use Steve Montano as our participant. We decided to conduct our test with Steve because we thought that he fit our description of a typical user for at least one of our tasks. Steve is up until this point a casual musician who has very little to no experience playing music with other people. We expect our users to be in a relatively casual setting while using our application, so we mainly focussed on finding a test location that was quiet enough to be able to communicate. We eventually decided to conduct the test in Steve’s own common room in Greylock, a space typically used for reading and the occasional conversation. While we did not provide Steve with a formal consent form, we did make sure to communicate to steve that 1.) his participation is completely voluntary and he can leave at any point, 2.) we are testing how well the prototype intuitively helps the user complete certain tasks, 3.) this is in no way an evaluation of Steve’s ability. After this, we introduced the paper prototype to Steve and explained that it is intended to mimic the interface of a mobile application where Steve has the ability to tap on elements to select, as well as swiping and typing as appropriate. We informed Steve that he is encouraged to talk out his actions, and that no observation is too trivial to mention, as we are interested in the unique insights he might have, especially those about confusing parts of our application flow. We especially encouraged him to ask questions, but to be mindful of the fact that we will likely not be able to answer them unless they are critical to the continuance of the test.

Task 1.)
	To start the usability test, we informed Steve that his task was to “find a group of musical peers to play music with in the near future.”
	
Task 2.)
  	 For the second task, we told Steve that he is currently part of a band and his task was to act as band manager for the group.

###  Test 1 Summary:



## Usability Test 2 ("Strawberry Blast"):
In terms of demographics, "Strawberry Blast" is functionally the same as "Steve Montano". We conducted the interview in the same location as the last interview showed that it was a reliable and quiet testing environment. Before conducting the test we stated the same information we gave to Steve in the first test. For more detail, please refer to Usability Test 1.


Task 1.)
	To start the usability test, we informed "Strawberry Blast" that his task was to “find a group of musical peers to play music with in the near future.”

Task 2.)
  	 For the second task, we told Barry that he is currently part of a band and his task was to act as band manager for the group.

## Usability Test 3 ("Barry Baritone")
We decided to ask Barry to be a participant in our usability test because he represents a demographic of musicians who are a bit more experienced with managing bands. He has been playing in several different groups for years and thus provides a perspective that is different from the first two participants, but still within our target range for our application. We conducted the interview in the same location as the last interview showed that it was a reliable and quiet testing environment. Before conducting the test we stated the same information we gave to Steve in the first test. For more detail, please refer to Usability Test 1.


Task 1.)
