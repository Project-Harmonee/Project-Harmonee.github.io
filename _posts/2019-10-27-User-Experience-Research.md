### Problem and Solution Overview

Currently, there are a wealth of resources for learning new instruments and uploading music online on an individual basis. While this is certainly something to be celebrated, there are no resources for musicians to connect with, learn from, inspire, and motivate each other. There are thousands of artists that want to collaborate with others but don’t know where to find people who share similar interests and have the same vision. Even then, people who happen to be in groups feel like they are stuck or stagnating as artists: they don’t know what the next step is. The process of moving from noodling in jam sessions to recording in the studio or performing at gigs is may present a significant challenge. There is plenty of latent potential that is locked away and, as a result, hundreds of songs and musical project not being made. Harmonee’s mission is to unlock this potential, making the logistics of band formation and maintenance from something that is a burden into something that is exciting and painless. Our use of a mobile app format lead to the two tasks we found most important: establishing a network of musicians, and thoughtful preparation for events. 

### Design Research Goals, Stakeholders, and Participants:

We first interviewed Milly Sanders [pseudonym]. She is the front-woman of an up-and-coming band on campus. She is also currently in the process of building a new band to potentially perform in the area. We came across her by chance while walking through campus, as she was in the middle of practicing with her band ahead of an upcoming show. We decided to conduct our semi-structured interview/contextual inquiry in one of the unused common rooms in Greylock quad. Based on what we learned about the process in which Milly has formed bands, this environment is not unlike the ones she would normally be corresponding with potential bandmates or setting up practice/jam sessions. Our design was a mixture of a semi-structured interview and contextual inquiry, as much of the band-formation process we would have liked to have observed could not easily be done or initiated artificially.
Next, we interviewed John, a local musician and educator from the Berkshires. He has served as a band manager in his personal groups as well as hired musicians for various sessions and performances. Given John’s significant musical background and experience, we thought he would be a great person to ask about starting a band, particularly from the standpoint of a leader/organizer. We began in the style of a semi-structured interview, asking about the first steps of starting a band, the nature of jam sessions, the creative process, delegating responsibilities, and handling different personality types. After this, we conducted a contextual inquiry by walking John through the hypothetical scenario of a performance situation, asking him to expound upon the various considerations that come along with it.
For our third interview, we conducted a mixture of a semi-structured interview with Albert Shelley, a Berkshires guitarist with decades of experience forming bands and performing in various contexts. Because of the retrospective and hypothetical nature of the questions we needed to ask him, we conducted our interview in a booth at Lee’s. We followed a format in which we asked him hypothetical questions around the processes needed to start a band, followed by asking him how these processes have actually worked out for him in his career.

### Design Research Results and Themes:

	One of the higher level themes we identified was that it is often that the individual responsibilities of the group are not delegated. There are many logistical and interpersonal obstacles to sharing content with the world Interpersonal conflict can inhibit the initial creation of bands. In addition, the lack of experience with other musicians constrains beginners to have to pick other musicians to play with who may not be very compatible. I think these themes inform of us of several tasks we might need to address in our design, including: Finding people who have compatible leadership types to the user (do not want too many cooks in the kitchen, or no cooks at all), getting people in contact with other musicians to grow their network and experiences (meet-up events, impromptu jam sessions), and ensuring that prep-work is given its due diligence prior to gigs (enough practice scheduled i.e. group scheduling, locating backup equipment, pre-show checklist).

### Answers to Task Analysis Questions:

Our target audience is up-and-coming musicians looking for others to make music with, in addition to members of a band looking for a new piece (drummer, bassist, etc). To find others, musicians put up advertisements or rely on chance meetings between musicians (happening to hear a potential new singer singing in the stairwell, for example). Our aspiring band members want to ensure that individual responsibilities are properly delegated, performances are fulfilling, creative energies blossom collectively, communication and expectations to be clear, and musicians to get along with each other. Generally these tasks are learned by getting band members together, where personalities interact, ideas are posed and built upon, and logistical considerations are recognized. These tasks are performed in rehearsal spaces (garages, music departments) and performance spaces (concert halls, night clubs, bars). Our target user provides data to the service according to their skills and experiences, specialties, and preferences. The tools our users usually have are their band equipment, phone, and possibly a network of other musicians they have created via experience. Our target users communicate face to face as well as in group chats, with tasks are performed regularly, perhaps once a week. Time constraints may become relevant when a group is getting studio time to record or need to develop a set list for an upcoming gig. When things go wrong, musicians in our target group need to feel prepared to handle and face adversity on the spot.

### Proposed Design Sketches

#### Design 1

![design_1!](/img/design_1.jpg)

This design addresses the task of building musical networks through the Explore feature. By navigating to the Explore page in the navigation bar at the bottom, they can view show bands with similar or compatible sounds in their area. In this way, they can get in touch with other groups for the purpose of collaboration. They can also promote certain artists through the “Featured Artist of the Day” link. Next, the design addresses the task of preparing for events thoughtfully in the Calendar view. By providing suggestions for potential events, Harmonee sets up the user for success by giving them actionable ways to be prepared. The design addresses the task of band trajectory through the Stats view of the app, which contains a “Band Trajectory Rating” section. This section lists specific sources of success or areas the group is lacking in. Lastly, this design addresses the task of ensuring clear communication between members through the built-in group chat and direct message functionality. Having a built in chat encourages members to stay in touch and accountable for one another. Band members may send mp3’s, pictures, links, and text to each other.

#### Design 2

![This could be your new band!](/img/design_2_2.jpg)

In this design, the task of “thoughtful Preparation for events” is accomplished by opening a “Pre-Show Checklist” notification that is sent to the user at an appropriate time before an upcoming show. Upon opening the notification, the app will take you to a checklist of all the things that are needed, indicating what is provided by the venue, and what is most-commonly forgotten. Next, task  of “obtaining creative guidance” is accomplished by opening the app and navigating to the creativity tools tab which will be highlighted by a star when it contains a notice. Here, creative suggestions will be indicated via a large exclamation mark over the element in question (ex. set-list, song, etc.). Touching the exclamation point will open a pop-up notice that will communicate the advice to the user. The task of “building musical networks” is accomplished by sending a notification to the user’s phone, indicating that the algorithm has selected them (based on location, instrument, and hundreds of other metrics) to potentially be a part of a Harmonee organized Jam-Event. Opening the notification allows the user to accept or reject the invitation, while also giving information about the time, location, and other relevant aspects. Lastly, this design intends to accomplish the task of “delegation of logistics” through short reminder notifications sent to each band member. The intention is to make the most important information readable from the initial notification banner so that in most cases all users have to do is look at their phone to be reminded about what they are responsible for.

#### Design 3

![This could be your new band!](/img/design_3.jpg)

  This design accomplishes the task of “obtaining creative guidance” by listening in on band practice sessions and using its algorithm to come up with constructive criticism based on the performance of the band. At the end of each song, the assistant will talk to the band and communicate their weak points and provide a way to improve. One way that this design accomplishes this task of “delegation of logistics” is by using its sensors to detect who is present and (not present) within practice sessions. It uses this information to inform the band members of such deficiencies and recommend actions intended to mend the situation. Effectively, it delegates most, if not all relevant logistical responsibilities to itself, a virtual member of the band. Next, this design accomplishes the “band trajectory” task by having the assistant always look for opportunities to heighten the status of the band during while it is on. It will verbally communicate these opportunities to the band and suggest a course of action that allow the band to make decisions to make the most out of the opportunities. Lastly, this design accomplishes this task of “thoughtful preparation for events” by giving members of the band “friendly-reminders” about things they should especially remember prior to the event.
  
### Written Scenarios

![design_2](/img/DesignReviewT2P1.jpg)
![design_2](/img/DesignReviewT2P2.jpg)

The above storyboard follows Gary the guitarist as he uses Harmonee to accomplish the task of building a musical network. At first, we can see Gary’s motivation by the fact that he does not know anyone to play with. He starts up Harmonee on his mobile device and initially sets up his application based on his goals as an individual. We then see how Gary sets up his Harmonee account to include a recording of his playing, as well as various other prompts to help him find the perfect set of people for him. After some time, he receives a notification that a Harmonee match has been made based on his previous inputs. This prompts the scheduling of a “Test Match Event” that Gary accepts so that he can meet and attempt to play with the musicians that the algorithm has deemed to be a suitable matching. After the members have met and played together, the app asks for a rating for the session, and asks each user if they are interested in forming a band now that they have experienced what it is like to play with these other musicians.

![design_2](/img/design_review_1.jpg)

The above storyboard attempts to show a user experience with the “thoughtful preparation of events” task. A band member realizes too late that they are missing an all-important mic stand at their performance. Seeing this, Ozzy wants to prevent this from happening in the future. He adds mic stand as a forgotten item so that at the time of their upcoming performance (in the Harmonee calendar), they will be reminded of the things that they listed as important and forgotten. Not only this, but Harmonee will remind users of various items and considerations that are commonly forgotten by other users as well. This way, users can be prepared for things they expected and avoid the failures of the past AND prepare for those things they may not have considered or expected.
