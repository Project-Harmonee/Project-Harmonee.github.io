Our design intends to offer musicians of all skill levels a platform to automatically create the perfect band to fit their needs. We offer this service to musicians who want to enrich their own musical abilities in a group setting that fulfills their requirements for music type, location, band size, and hundreds of other factors that are beyond their ability of communicating properly. Essentially, our targets are people who want to form a band that not only fits their describable needs, but also has that certain “je ne sais quoi” that makes a group greater than the sum of its parts. Functionally, this group includes all musicians wanting to perform with others. Considering the lack of support for musical talents at Williams outside of established groups within the music department, there exists a body of musicians on campus who fall into our target ranges. Alternatively, we believe that conducting a partially retrospective contextual inquiry with members of well known bands within the Berkshires would be useful in gaining insight on the issue relevant to band formation. 
Our first contextual inquiry, which will take place the weekend of the 28th of September, will include a Williams student who is looking to play with a new group of people. When conducting our inquiry, we will focus on the steps the student is currently taking to find other musicians (this might be in the form of being with them while they email or speak to other prospective musicians) as well as asking about previous actions the interviewee has taken to further this goal. We want to ask questions that give us insight about how much the interviewee actually knows about what kind of qualities they want in bandmates. We also want to observe the types of things that are especially frustrating for the musician going through this process. 
For our second contextual inquiry, we want to meet with either John Kelly or Andrew Kelly, Berkshire musicians who also teach a Winter Study course on “busking.” In their course, they facilitate the creation of bands who will eventually have to perform together at the end of the course. We would like to focus on their process of organizing the class into groups in ways that make for quality performances year after year. We might focus on the planning they do prior to the course to make sure that students have the resources to effectively form cohesive bands. So far, we have contacted John and Andrew and are awaiting their response to our request for a meeting. 
Lastly, we want to conduct a contextual inquiry with at least one member of a band on campus looking for a new member to join their existing group of musicians. Here we want to focus on the steps they are taking to find someone (if we are extremely lucky, we might even be able to sit in a band try-out). We also want to focus on the group dynamics that already exist to gauge what kind of relationships work and do not work in these settings. This might be achieved through sitting in on a band practice session.
