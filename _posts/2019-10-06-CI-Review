We interviewed Milly Sanders [pseudonym]. She is the front-woman of an up-and-coming band on campus. She is also currently in the process of building a new band to potentially perform in the area. We came across her by chance while walking through campus, as she was in the middle of practicing with her band ahead of an upcoming show. We decided to conduct our semi-structured interview/contextual inquiry in one of the unused common rooms in Greylock quad. Based on what we learned about the process in which Milly has formed bands, this environment is not unlike the ones she would normally be corresponding with potential bandmates or setting up practice/jam sessions.
Our design was a mixture of a semi-structured interview and contextual inquiry, as much of the band-formation process we would have liked to have observed could not easily be done or initiated artificially. The first section of the interview included general questions about band creating experiences on campus, followed by asking her to walk us through in as much detail as possible whenever she referenced a specific moment. It was often her first reaction to speak about the process in generalities with respect to these past events, however we were able to get deeper responses by asking a lot of “how” and “why” questions in regards to specific events. For example, when asked about her latest encounters with a potential bandmates, she naturally jumped from the instance in which they first met through a capella, to the instance of their first gig. Here, we tried to ask her about a lot of the minutiae of the in-between like “who initiated the practices?”, “who found out about the gig?,” and “who represented the group” to the organizers of the venue. This was especially true when we sensed that she was speaking about something that was particularly stressful or contentious. Lastly, we used a contextual inquiry structure to have Milly take us through what her next steps would be in starting a brand-new band that she was in the middle of creating. We started with her showing us the initial text messages she had sent out to potential band-mates, followed by her talking us through what her considerations might be going forward concerning things like the “sound” of the players, and how well she knows them already.
In the contextual inquiry we learned a great deal about how the process of band formation happens organically, and the problems that arise. Since Milly was integral in getting all of the members together, she felt as though she settled into her role as the sort of de facto band manager. During the course of her experience as band manager, Milly encountered numerous areas of interpersonal friction. For one, the initial step of delegating responsibilities in the group proved to be problematic. Despite claiming that she “was the worst instrumentalist,” she was the greatest source of songwriting; instead of bouncing ideas off one another, the other members of the band would go along with her ideas. This disconnect caused her to reflect on the process of developing a repertoire of songs to play: should you begin with covers of songs or a chord progression? If you decide to be a cover band to start, how do we make sure everyone enjoys the songs we play? Moving forward, how do we choose the inspirations that inform how we develop our own sound? Another problem Milly encountered is that she didn’t set up regular meeting times for practicing and building up a workable setlist beforehand, instead opting for irregular rehearsals in the case that they had an upcoming gig. To Milly, this lack of preparation and regularity held the band back from realizing their potential: "If you’re not expected to perform right away, you can develop your set better.” Furthermore, because college students have little free time outside of their classes and extracurriculars/sports, rehearsals demand a certain level of productivity and efficiency. This leaves little room for creativity, Milly asserted, further stunting group growth and development. After hearing these complaints, we reflect on the ways that these areas of friction can be smoothed and lubricated by technology. We had some idea that we wanted to handle the logistical aspects of band formation, but the interview made us grapple with this goal in new ways: how do we handle song suggestions, delegating band roles, balancing productivity with creativity? These questions remain open, but could be an interesting avenue for exploration going forward in the next inquiries.

We interviewed John, a local musician and educator from the Berkshires. He has served as a band manager in his personal groups as well as hired musician for various sessions and performances. Given John’s significant musical background and experience, we thought he would be a great person to ask about starting a band, particularly from the standpoint of a leader/organizer. We began in the style of a semi-structured interview, asking about the first steps of starting a band, the nature of jam sessions, the creative process, delegating responsibilities, and handling different personality types. After this, we conducted a contextual inquiry by walking John through the hypothetical scenario of a performance situation, asking him to expound upon the various considerations that come along with it. 

We learned a great deal from the interview section. John emphasized the importance of finding like-minded individuals that share a common vision, but also the importance of having clear expectations about various member’s roles in the group and their commitment level to the group. Since often bands spend years playing gigs for little pay as they grow and develop, you want to make sure that you’re not doing it for the money: you’re doing it because you love it. This naturally lead into a discussion of the nature of the creative process, where John said that while he usually would lead the songwriting, consulting with other group members lead to a variety of outcomes: sometimes he would make the entire song as complete, while other times the songwriter would consult the others for opinions on guitar riffs or structure. Importantly, there is an unwritten rule that the person making the song has a final say on suggestions. While there can be some friction if there is a sense of responsibility to let others write, John boldly says “I’m not going to throttle back my creativity just because you aren’t as prolific.” While this may seem to be a rather harsh statement, it shows the way that ego can get in the way of the bigger picture; the primary concern should be what is good for the band and in the end, “you don’t want too many cooks in the kitchen.” 

In John’s walkthrough of the performance process, he first of all make a distinction between playing for a show you’ve been hired for and one where you perform original music. For a hired gig, especially a jazz show, everyone is a hired professional that reads out of a jazz book; outside of improvisation in solos. For original music, however, preparation is key when developing a setlist and running it well in advance. A key consideration is that you have to prepare for the worst when performance time comes. Some problems can be controlled, such as having a backup cord when one goes bad, but others, like if a guitar string breaks just before you go onstage, are not. In the latter situation, being able to think on the fly to problem solve (such as asking another band if they can borrow a guitar) is crucial. 

# Subject 3
    For our third interview, we conducted a mixture of a semi-structured interview with Albert Shelley, a Berkshires guitarist with decades of experience forming bands and performing in various contexts. Because of the retrospective and hypothetical nature of the questions we needed to ask him, we conducted our interview in a booth at Lee’s.

    We followed a format in which we asked him hypothetical questions around the processes needed to start a band, followed by asking him how these processes have actually worked out for him in his career. One example was when we asked him how he would go about finding your first bandmate to play with if he had to perform sometime in the next two months. Albert decided to answer the question first as if he were a complete beginner in the process (ie back as a student at Williams) and then as if he were going to do this right now. While describing the process in the first scenario, he mentioned that the process is largely organic and “by chance”. He described a situation in which he would be walking back from class and hear a random student playing the guitar. The process for him was just to walk up to them and ask them to jam with him at some later time. From his description of this process, as well as other points in the interview, we were clued into the theme of needing to be outgoing, potentially awkward, and willing to face rejection.

    Another moment that stood out that also contributed to the identification of this theme was when he talked about the process of getting gigs. We learned that much of the process is about putting oneself out there by visiting venues and risking rejection by simply asking for gigs. He mentioned that even at his experience level, the process remains largely the same in that bands have to be proactive if they want to perform in any capacity.

    We were also surprised to see how some processes change for bands and individuals who have more experience. When Albert described the process of how he would try to find his first bandmate, he emphasized the value of his sizeable network of musicians that he had been able to build up from years of experience. This was our first hint at the theme of sheer experience being a great factor in the successful creation of a band. When getting into the process of knowing which types of people will or will not be a “good fit” for a hypothetical band he has created, he mentioned that it involves simply just trying out a lot of different people, because beyond the basic requirements for genre, instrument, and skill, the best way to get a good match is by “trial and error.”   
# Affinity Insights

The higher level themes we identified were:

It is often that the individual responsibilities of the group are not delegated
There are many logistical and interpersonal obstacles to sharing content with the world
Interpersonal conflict can inhibit the initial creation of bands

I think these themes inform of us of several tasks we may need to address in our design, including:
Finding people who have compatible leadership types to the user (do not want too many cooks in the kitchen, or no cooks at all)
Getting people in contact with other musicians to grow their network and experiences (meet-up events, impromptu jam sessions)
Ensuring that prep-work is given its due diligence prior to gigs (enough practice scheduled i.e. group scheduling, locating backup equipment, pre-show checklist)

Our process consisted of throwing problems and insights from the three interviews on the table with no consideration about how they might be grouped up. From there, we tried to pair cards together in multiple ways, justifying its inclusion with multiple other cards until we found a pairing that we were most satisfied with. After we made our initial groups, we identified themes by thinking of an idea that encapsulates most of the notes we included, and then thought about how well that note fits with the overall ideas given by each of the three groups. 
# Task Analysis Questions
Our target audience is up-and-coming musicians looking for others to make music with. Alternatively, members of a band looking for a new piece (drummer, bassist, etc).
To find others, they put up advertisements or rely on chance meetings between musicians (happening to hear a potential new singer singing in the stairwell), for example).
Our aspiring band members want to ensure that individual responsibilities are properly delegated, performances are fulfilling, creative energies blossom collectively, communication and expectations to be clear, and musicians to get along with each other.
Tasks are learned by getting band members together, where personalities interact, ideas are posed and built upon, and logistical considerations are recognized.
Tasks are performed in rehearsal spaces (garages, music departments) and performance spaces (concert halls, night clubs, bars)
The person provides data to the service according to their skill and experiences, specialties, and preferences.
The person has their band equipment, phone, and possibly their network of other musicians they have created via experience.
People communicate face to face and in group chats.
Tasks are performed regularly, perhaps once a week.
Time constraints may become relevant when a group is getting studio time to record or need to develop a set list for an upcoming gig.
When things go wrong, group members need to feel prepared to handle and face adversity.
