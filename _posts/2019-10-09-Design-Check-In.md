## Task Review Redux

### Leadership-oriented matching
Harry wants to start a band but he remembers that in his last band he often butted heads with another member over a lot of the leadership responsibilities like sound direction and band representation. Harry wants to find people who are ok with him taking this leadership position. Peter is more interested in just playing his banjo with other musicians and doesn’t care much about being a band leader, however he understands that someone has to be a band leader or the musical project will risk dying from lack of direction. Harry and Peter have the task of finding people who will complement their respective leadership styles.  

### Building musical networks
Justin has been a “bedroom-guitarist” for years and is ready to start being in a band. Justin has never played with other musicians, so he has no musical network to use to find potential band members. Justin has the task of experiencing playing alongside other musicians so he can build his network and have a list of potential band members later on (Harmonee organized meet-up events, impromptu jam sessions).

### Thoughtful Preparation for Events
The band Julius Seizure has their first gig coming up, but have no idea what types of things they need to do for their band to ensure that prep-work is given its due diligence. What types of things go wrong? How much should they be practicing? They need to come up with a condensed list of all the things they need to do and bring prior to the gig.

### Delegation of Logistics
The Slim Jims suffer from a severe lack of organization, making logistics a huge hassle. They have trouble handling logistical issues at rehearsal and performance time: from figuring out transportation, to getting gigs. The Slim Jims need a place where they can clearly define the steps ahead so that these logistical details feel more manageable. It would also be helpful if they could delegate these responsibilities across the different members so that everyone shares the workload fairly.

### Band Trajectory
Jane Doe feels like she and her band are getting nowhere. During practices, they usually noodle around, playing on their instruments without listening to each other. Nobody is satisfied with the work that they produce; they lack a clearly-defined vision of who they want to be. Jane’s band needs a trajectory for them to grow and develop according to their goals. This could include deadlines for songs to be polished, opportunities to play for a wider audience, and reflections on growth over time to provide context to the current state of the band.

### Clear Communication between Members
Jeff and Edward are yelling at each other about who was responsible for bring the bass amp to their most recent performance. It’s Edward’s amp, but Jeff was the one who drove everyone to the show and was rushing everyone to be on time. In any case, the bass amp is back home and the group is bass amp-less. This misunderstanding stemmed from a lack of accountability and ownership of responsibility, but ultimately from a lack of communication. Establishing clear lines of communication between band members is important so that misunderstandings are avoided. In this way, the accountability and reliability of individual members is maintained.

### Musicianship and Creativity

Annie has just started a band but unfortunately none of the band members have that much experience playing their instruments or the creative process of (ex. writing songs and creating set-lists). Annie would like to have some guidance and advice throughout the process of playing and creating music. 

## Design Check-In

![design_1!](/img/design_1.jpg)

### Design 1
This design takes a social media oriented, “band profile”-centered approach to Harmonee. The start screen is the band profile, including the band’s name, picture, description, the band group chat, and circular bubble picture links of each band member’s individual profile. On tapping a given band member’s picture, they go to that member’s DM’s with that given band member. Outside of the band profile, users may go to the explore page to see similar bands close by, the Harmonee top charts, a featured group of the day, and more. The stats page shows interesting statistics about the band’s progress so far, as well as a “Band Trajectory Rating” which shows the good and bad about what the group has done thus far and where they need to go to reach their goals. Finally, the calendar view shows upcoming events defined by the group, as well as Harmonee-defined suggested events based on publicly available data as well as the private Band Trajectory suggestions.

#### Task: Building musical networks
- This design addresses the task of building musical networks through the Explore feature. By navigating to the Explore page in the navigation bar at the bottom, they can view show bands with similar or compatible sounds in their area. In this way, they can get in touch with other groups for the purpose of collaborationthey also promote certain artists through the "Featured Artist of the Day" link. 

#### Task: Thoughtful preparation for events
- The design addresses the task of preparing for events thoughtfully in the Calendar view. By providing suggestions for potential events, Harmonee sets up the user for success by giving them actionable ways to be prepared.

#### Task: Band Trajectory
- The design addresses the task of band trajectory through the Stats view of the app, which contains a "Band Trajectory Rating" section. This section lists specific sources of success or areas the group is lacking in. 
#### Task: Clear Communication between members

- This design addresses the task of ensuring clear communication between members through the built-in group chat and direct message functionality. Having a built in chat encourages members to stay in touch and accountable for one another. Band members may send mp3’s, pictures, links, and text to each other.

### Design 2
The design makes use of a smart-phone application format, where the platform communicates with the user through notifications. For example, when the Harmonee “Jam Event” algorithm determines that there are enough varied Harmonee users in an area, it will invite those users via phone notification to a Harmonee organized jam-session. Notifications lead to screens within the app with more information about the notification, depending on the nature of the alert. The app also has lower priority in-app notifications that are all guided to make the user aware of ways to improve their band processes and creative process (ie schedules, song organization, set list). The main idea of the app is that the higher value functions will make themselves clearly apparent via notifications based on the current state of the band or individual.

#### Task: Thoughtful Preparation for Events (Frames 1 + 2)
- In this design, this task is accomplished by opening a “Pre-Show Checklist” notification that is sent to the user at an appropriate time before an upcoming show. Upon opening the notification, the app will take you to a checklist of all the things that are needed, indicating what is provided by the venue, and what is most-commonly forgotten.

#### Task: Creative Guidance (Frames 2 + 3)
- In this design, this task is accomplished by opening the app and navigating to the creativity tools tab which will be highlighted by a star when it contains a notice. Here, creative suggestions will be indicated via a large exclamation mark over the element in question (ex. set-list, song, etc.). Touching the exclamation point will open a pop-up notice that will communicate the advice to the user.

#### Task: Building musical networks
- Task 2 is accomplished by sending a notification to the user’s phone, indicating that the algorithm has selected them (based on location, instrument, and *hundreds of other metrics*) to potentially be a part of a Harmonee organized Jam-Event. Opening the notification allows the user to accept or reject the invitation, while also giving information about the time, location, and other relevant aspects.
#### Task: Delegation of Logistics
- This design intends to accomplish this task through short reminder notifications sent to each band member. The intention is to make the most important information readable from the initial notification banner so that in most cases all users have to do is look at their phone to be reminded about what they are responsible for.

### Design 3

This design makes use of a personal assistant that collects data on the group during rehearsals (and potentially during performances). The Harmonee personal assistant uses this data to provide helpful suggestions for the group to consider. For example, it could bring attention to certain aspects of their sound that they may not have considered (tempo changes, unusual chord choices, etc). It may also take note of members that are not as committed, potential opportunities at their next performances, and relevant details before they head out (time, location, extra considerations).

### Task: Creative Guidance
This design accomplishes this task by listening in on band practice sessions and using its algorithm to come up with constructive criticism based on the performance of the band. At the end of each song, the assistant will talk to the band and communicate their weak points and provide a way to improve.

### Task: Delegation of Logistics
One way that this design accomplishes this task is by using its sensors to detect who is present and (not present) within practice sessions. It uses this information to inform the band members of such deficiencies and recommend actions intended to mend the situation. Effectively, it delegates most, if not all relevant logistical responsibilities to itself, a virtual member of the band.

### Task: Band Trajectory
This design accomplishes this task by having the assistant always look for opportunities to heighten the status of the band during while it is on. It will verbally communicate these opportunities to the band  and suggest a course of action that allow the band to make decisions to make the most out of the opportunities.

### Task: Thoughtful Preparation for Events
This design accomplishes this task by giving members of the band “friendly-reminders” about things they should especially remember prior to the event.
