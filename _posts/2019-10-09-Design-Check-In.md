## Task Review Redux

### Leadership-oriented matching
Harry wants to start a band but he remembers that in his last band he often butted heads with another member over a lot of the leadership responsibilities like sound direction and band representation. Harry wants to find people who are ok with him taking this leadership position. Peter is more interested in just playing his banjo with other musicians and doesn’t care much about being a band leader, however he understands that someone has to be a band leader or the musical project will risk dying from lack of direction. Harry and Peter have the task of finding people who will complement their respective leadership styles.  

### Building musical networks
Justin has been a “bedroom-guitarist” for years and is ready to start being in a band. Justin has never played with other musicians, so he has no musical network to use to find potential band members. Justin has the task of experiencing playing alongside other musicians so he can build his network and have a list of potential band members later on (Harmonee organized meet-up events, impromptu jam sessions).

### Thoughtful Preparation for Events
The band Julius Seizure has their first gig coming up, but have no idea what types of things they need to do for their band to ensure that prep-work is given its due diligence. What types of things go wrong? How much should they be practicing? They need to come up with a condensed list of all the things they need to do and bring prior to the gig.

### Delegation of Logistics
The Slim Jims suffer from a severe lack of organization, making logistics a huge hassle. They have trouble handling logistical issues at rehearsal and performance time: from figuring out transportation, to getting gigs. The Slim Jims need a place where they can clearly define the steps ahead so that these logistical details feel more manageable. It would also be helpful if they could delegate these responsibilities across the different members so that everyone shares the workload fairly.

### Band Trajectory
Jane Doe feels like she and her band are getting nowhere. During practices, they usually noodle around, playing on their instruments without listening to each other. Nobody is satisfied with the work that they produce; they lack a clearly-defined vision of who they want to be. Jane’s band needs a trajectory for them to grow and develop according to their goals. This could include deadlines for songs to be polished, opportunities to play for a wider audience, and reflections on growth over time to provide context to the current state of the band.

### Clear Communication between Members
Jeff and Edward are yelling at each other about who was responsible for bring the bass amp to their most recent performance. It’s Edward’s amp, but Jeff was the one who drove everyone to the show and was rushing everyone to be on time. In any case, the bass amp is back home and the group is bass amp-less. This misunderstanding stemmed from a lack of accountability and ownership of responsibility, but ultimately from a lack of communication. Establishing clear lines of communication between band members is important so that misunderstandings are avoided. In this way, the accountability and reliability of individual members is maintained.

### Design 1
This design takes a social media oriented, “band profile”-centered approach to Harmonee. The start screen is the band profile, including the band’s name, picture, description, the band group chat, and circular bubble picture links of each band member’s individual profile. On tapping a given band member’s picture, they go to that member’s DM’s with that given band member. Band members may send mp3’s, pictures, and text to each other. Outside of the band profile, users may go to the explore page to see similar bands close by, the Harmonee top charts, a featured group of the day, and more. The stats page shows interesting statistics about the band’s progress so far, as well as a “Band Trajectory Rating” which shows the good and bad about what the group has done thus far and where they need to go to reach their goals. Finally, the calendar view shows upcoming events defined by the group, as well as Harmonee-defined suggested events based on publicly available data as well as the private Band Trajectory suggestions.

### Design 2
The design makes use of a smart-phone application format, where the platform communicates with the user through notifications. For example, when the Harmonee “Jam Event” algorithm determines that there are enough varied Harmonee users in an area, it will invite those users via phone notification to a Harmonee organized jam-session. Notifications lead to screens within the app with more information about the notification, depending on the nature of the alert. The app also has lower priority in-app notifications that are all guided to make the user aware of ways to improve their band processes and creative process (ie schedules, song organization, set list). The main idea of the app is that the higher value functions will make themselves clearly apparent via notifications based on the current state of the band or individual.

### Design 3

This design makes use of a personal assistant that collects data on the group during rehearsals (and potentially during performances). The Harmonee personal assistant uses this data to provide helpful suggestions for the group to consider. For example, it could bring attention to certain aspects of their sound that they may not have considered (tempo changes, unusual chord choices, etc). It may also take note of members that are not as committed, potential opportunities at their next performances, and relevant details before they head out (time, location, extra considerations).
