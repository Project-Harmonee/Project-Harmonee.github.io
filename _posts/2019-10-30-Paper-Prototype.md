## Paper Prototype

### Task 1, Building a Musical Network
![design_1!](/img/paper-proto-start.JPG)
This is the starting point for the app, which is intended to orient the user's experience closer to whichever task they are looking to complete. Because we are interested in accomplishing the task of building a musical network, we will select "Looking For a Band."

![design_1!](/img/paper-proto-profile.JPG)
This page allows the user to insert information about themselves that is relevant to finding other musicians that are compatible with them. THey are able to edit each section by tapping on them and typing their desired input. Most notably, the user is told that the matching system will begin after they submit a musical sample that they can record right from the app by pressing "Record Sample."

This is the part of the application where users record their music right into their device. It includes the standard audio recording tools, including playback, stop, and of course, record.

Some time after users have filled out their profile and provided a sample recording of their music, they will receive this notification about a new band matching. From here, they can simply open the notification to see the matching.

This screen shows the user a potential band matching. The page includes information on each of the potential band members, as well as some of the information that was used to make the matching. This screen also notifies the user of a "Test Jam Event" that they have the option of accepting so that they may meet these other musicians, and later potentially start a band.
