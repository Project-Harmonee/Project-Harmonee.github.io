With the rise of websites like Ultimate Guitar and Soundcloud, it’s easier than ever to both learn a new instrument and share your unique sound and talents to the world. However, while these resources can promote learning and artistic development at the individual level, they don't provide a way for musicians to connect with, learn from, inspire, and motivate one another. There are hundreds of songs not being made, musical ideas not being explored, and listeners not finding their new favorite song because artists don’t have the resources they need to find the group that they can vibe with on an emotional level. Furthermore, even if artists find themselves in a group they like, they may not know how to build the momentum required to get their group off the ground. There is a new challenge to move from noodling in jam sessions to performing on stage or recording in the studio. Think of the vast untapped potential present in each of the anonymous online vocalists, guitarists, producers, and drummers! Now think of the way that potential can be unlocked if only they could find the right people to jam, compose, and perform with. Harmonee is the way for artists to start a group, joining a community of artists, each showcase their sound and letting their creativity blossom.

The Harmonee app is organized into three distinct parts. The first is the group search feature, where users enter relevant data, such as the instrument(s) they play, size of the group they are looking for, their location information, the emotional qualities of the music they want to make, and, most importantly, a 10-second sample showcasing their work as an artist. Each of these data points will be fed into the Harmonee formation algorithm, searching for other band members in the database that fit their constraints and providing up to three potential groups they could be a good fit for. Once they meet up with their group and find that they get along with them, they create their group profile which will provide the group with actionable points of interest: weekly times to meet, deadlines to produce songs/EPs, studios to record at, venues for performance, and much more. The final part of the app is the Harmonee community, where songs uploaded to a group’s profile can be listened to by a community of musical peers or listeners. Groups may message others with opportunities to, for example, organize a multi-act concert. In this way, Harmonee is with content creators in every step of a group's development, continuing to work with them as they grow and improve.
