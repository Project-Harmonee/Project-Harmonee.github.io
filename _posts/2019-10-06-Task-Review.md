TASK REVIEW

- Finding people who have compatible leadership types to the user (having multiple leading people might lead to a sense of “upstaging” or “stealing one’s thunder,” while having two few leaders will cause the band to flounder in its lack of direction).
- Getting people in contact with other musicians to grow their network and experiences (meet-up events, impromptu jam sessions)
- Ensuring that prep-work is given its due diligence prior to gigs (enough practice scheduled i.e. group scheduling, locating backup equipment, pre-show checklist)
- Handling logistical issues at rehearsal and performance time, when it comes to scheduling rehearsals, figuring out transportation, and getting gigs
- Providing a trajectory for bands to grow and develop according to their goals (deadlines for songs to be polished, opportunities to play for a wider audience, and reflections on growth over time to provide context to the current state)
- Establishing clear lines of communication between band members so that misunderstandings are avoided and accountability and reliability of individual members is maintained.
