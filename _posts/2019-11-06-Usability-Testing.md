# Usability Testing

## Cognitive Walk-through

## Usability Test 1:
For our first usability test, we were able to use Steve Montano as our participant. We decided to conduct our test with Steve because we thought that he fit our description of a typical user for at least one of our tasks. Steve is up until this point a casual musician who has very little to no experience playing music with other people. We expect our users to be in a relatively casual setting while using our application, so we mainly focussed on finding a test location that was quiet enough to be able to communicate. We eventually decided to conduct the test in Steve’s own common room in Greylock, a space typically used for reading and the occasional conversation. While we did not provide Steve with a formal consent form, we did make sure to communicate to steve that 1.) his participation is completely voluntary and he can leave at any point, 2.) we are testing how well the prototype intuitively helps the user complete certain tasks, 3.) this is in no way an evaluation of Steve’s ability. After this, we introduced the paper prototype to Steve and explained that it is intended to mimic the interface of a mobile application where Steve has the ability to tap on elements to select, as well as swiping and typing as appropriate. We informed Steve that he is encouraged to talk out his actions, and that no observation is too trivial to mention, as we are interested in the unique insights he might have, especially those about confusing parts of our application flow. We especially encouraged him to ask questions, but to be mindful of the fact that we will likely not be able to answer them unless they are critical to the continuance of the test.

Task 1.)
	To start the usability test, we informed Steve that his task was to “find a group of musical peers to play music with in the near future.”

Task 2.)
  	 For the second task, we told Steve that he is currently part of a band and his task was to act as band manager for the group.

### Summary
After conducting the usability test, it looks as though we need to flesh out some of the features of our app a little bit more. There were moments where Steve assumed that tapping on certain elements would take you to screens that didn’t exist. Conversely, there were also situations where Steve was looking for a feature or element that was not there in order to accomplish something within the view, usually an elementary detail such as deleting a cell within a table. These minor oversights can have major implications for the usability and practicality of our app, and are very welcome criticisms. However, Steve went even further than using the time of the test just to critique the design details. At a higher level, Steve also thought about some of the ways that the group dynamics would play out within the app. When band members make contributions to the app or delete the work of themselves or others, who gets to decide what content remains? This got us really thinking about the policy we employ as creators handling user content. Should it be that anyone can add, say, to the preparation list, but that it requires a unanimous decision to remove items? If so, this could result in a flood of content that would be hard to manage. This leads to a discussion of whether we should codify the unofficial delegation of “band manager” into roles such as “Admin” and “Member.” This helps establish that a certain individual holds the responsibility of managing content, but also represents a threat to the egalitarian nature of members within a band, making certain members have a higher status than others. Steve was a fantastic test user; he allowed us to consider some of the important questions that don’t have clear answers. We hope that we can use the information from the test to more effectively design a system that simultaneously promotes member inclusion and effective data filtering and management.
